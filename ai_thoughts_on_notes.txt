Certainly! Here's the feedback in a copy-paste-friendly format for your document:
Top-level API (bladerf_set_frequency)

You have correctly identified that bladerf_set_frequency() is the user-facing API, which serves as the entry point for setting the frequency. This function essentially locks the device, delegates the frequency setting to the appropriate function pointer via dev->board->set_frequency(), and applies gain correction (if applicable).

    Correctness: ✅ The understanding is correct. You have correctly noted that this function calls dev->board->set_frequency(), which is a function pointer (defined in board_fns).

Board Structure (board.h)

In this section, you are showing the structure board_fns, which defines a pointer to the function set_frequency. This is where the abstraction happens, as the correct set_frequency function will be used based on the board type (BladeRF v1 or v2).

    Correctness: ✅ This part is correct. You’ve clearly shown that bladerf_boards will map the correct function pointer to the right board.

Second-layer: bladerf2.c

This is where the frequency-setting logic for BladeRF v2 (the second layer) starts. You’ve correctly highlighted the function bladerf2_set_frequency() passing the frequency setting request to board_data->rfic->set_frequency().

    Correctness: ✅ Your analysis is accurate here. The board_data->rfic->set_frequency function is a function pointer that will ultimately point to the function that interacts with the RFIC (Radio Frequency IC).

    Clarification: It’s important to note that board_data->rfic->set_frequency() might be initialized elsewhere in the code (probably in the initialization routines for the BladeRF v2 device), but that’s clear from the code structure you've outlined.

Third-layer: rfic_fpga.c (_rfic_fpga_set_frequency)

In this section, you're correctly identifying the _rfic_fpga_set_frequency function, which does the heavy lifting of checking frequency ranges and then calling _rfic_cmd_write() to write the frequency setting command.

    Correctness: ✅ This part is accurate. _rfic_fpga_set_frequency() checks the frequency range and delegates the actual frequency command to _rfic_cmd_write().

    Clarification: The _rfic_fpga_set_frequency function is essentially a helper that packages the frequency-setting logic and handles any necessary checks before calling the low-level function _rfic_cmd_write(). This is a typical abstraction layer to keep the logic modular and prevent redundant code.

Command Write (_rfic_cmd_write)

This part is important to understand the actual mechanism that sends the frequency command to the hardware. You’ve mentioned that _rfic_cmd_write() is called multiple times in the code and is used to interface with the backend (such as FPGA or host).

    Correctness: ✅ Your understanding is correct. _rfic_cmd_write() is responsible for sending commands to the hardware. The RFIC_ADDRESS(cmd, ch) is used to create the appropriate address for the command, and it then calls the backend’s rfic_command_write() function to actually perform the write.

    Clarification: You asked why _rfic_cmd_write appears in different places. The reason for this is that the function is reused for different kinds of RFIC commands (not just frequency). When setting the frequency, it’s used to format and send the frequency-related command, but it could be used elsewhere for other RFIC-related commands. The function name is a general-purpose name for "command writing," so it can be used for different RFIC actions, not just frequency.

Backend Write (USB/FPGA Backend)

You’ve correctly identified that the backend (FPGA or Host) handles the actual writing to the device. Specifically, in the rfic_fpga_control, you noted that rfic_command_write is mapped to nios_rfic_command_write, which then sends the command over USB.

    Correctness: ✅ This is accurate. The backend (likely implemented in a file like usb.c or nios_access.c) is responsible for the low-level communication with the hardware. nios_rfic_command_write() sends the command using a protocol that ultimately communicates with the FPGA (or another logic element).

    Clarification: The use of nios_16x64_write() is the actual mechanism that writes the data to the FPGA over the Nios II soft processor bus. It’s a low-level interaction with the hardware that abstracts the details of the specific command being executed. This function is used for various RFIC commands.

Very Low-Level: USB Write

In your final section, you delve into the very low-level details of the USB write using nios_access() or nios_access_quiet(). This function interacts with the USB controller to send the Nios II command over USB.

    Correctness: ✅ This is correct. nios_access() sends the write request over USB using bulk_transfer, a standard USB transfer method. This part of the chain is responsible for the actual communication between the host and the FPGA device.

    Clarification: The nios_access() function actually handles the USB communication part. It sends the command to the device (e.g., FPGA) using usb->fn->bulk_transfer(). This is where the actual data (the frequency value, for instance) is transmitted to the hardware.

Additional Thoughts:
1. FPGA vs. Host Controller:

It seems like you're considering whether the controller should be "FPGA" or "Host." Here’s a quick explanation:

    FPGA Controller: If you choose the FPGA as the controller, you're interacting with the hardware directly (e.g., setting frequency, gain, etc.) through FPGA logic. This is typically how most BladeRF operations are done, as the FPGA handles much of the signal processing.

    Host Controller: If you choose the host controller, you would be interacting with the device from the perspective of the host computer. You could still send commands to the FPGA through the USB interface, but the processing logic would happen on the host side rather than on the FPGA.

For frequency settings and similar low-level device operations, using the FPGA controller makes sense because the FPGA is responsible for manipulating the RFIC settings at the hardware level. The host would typically send high-level commands to the FPGA, which does the actual work.
2. Use of FPGA Logic for Frequency Settings:

Since you're dealing with RFICs and frequency settings, you would likely continue using FPGA logic (as indicated by _rfic_fpga_set_frequency() and related functions) because the FPGA is responsible for these low-level RFIC operations. Using the host controller would typically be for higher-level tasks, such as managing the overall device state, interacting with the user, or performing non-hardware-specific logic.
Summary and Recommendations:

Your understanding is generally correct, and you've done a good job of breaking down the various layers involved in setting the frequency on the BladeRF. Here's a quick summary:

    Top-Level API (bladerf_set_frequency) → Delegates to the dev->board->set_frequency() function pointer.

    Second Layer (bladerf2_set_frequency) → Delegates to the board_data->rfic->set_frequency() function pointer, which points to FPGA-related logic.

    Third Layer (_rfic_fpga_set_frequency) → Performs checks and calls _rfic_cmd_write() to write the frequency to the hardware.

    Backend (USB) → Uses low-level USB access functions (nios_access(), nios_16x64_write()) to communicate with the FPGA.

In short, you’re correct in using the FPGA as the controller for frequency settings, as the FPGA handles these low-level RFIC operations.

I hope this helps clarify your understanding! Feel free to ask for further explanations if something is unclear.
